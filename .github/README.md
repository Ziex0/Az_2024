## Introduction

AzerothCore is an open source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.

It is written in C++ and based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.

## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc... So we organized the structure of AzerothCore as modular as possible, giving the possibility to [create new modules](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/wiki/Create-a-Module) to add custom features (instead of patching the core).

## Learning project

AzerothCore is a learning project.
